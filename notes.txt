1. generate_traffic.py
	- can set params such as # vehicles/walkers, speed, etc.

2. automatic_cotrol.py
	- can choose agent behavior types (normal/agressive/cautious)
	- set CameraManager.recording = True to save rgb camera images to disk
		issue: the pygame GUI stuck while the simulation continues bc saving image takes time
	- in Hub.tick()
		vehicles = [(dist(x.get_location()), x) for x in vehicles if x.id != world.player.id]
		stores distance of each vehicle to the ego.
