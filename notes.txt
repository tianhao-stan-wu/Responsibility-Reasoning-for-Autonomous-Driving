brainstorm driving norms in different driving scenarios:

easy to formulate: (constraint on control directly)
Avoid Unnecessary Braking especially on highway or driving with high speed
take turns at a stop or merge
Don't Block the Intersection even if the light is green,
avoid acceleration when being overtaken

hard: (constraint on the state, using reachability)
Stay in Your Lane After a Turn
keep R_safe from other vehicles/pedestrians
avoid side by side driving
