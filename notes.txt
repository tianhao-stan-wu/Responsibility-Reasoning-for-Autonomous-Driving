brainstorm driving norms in different driving scenarios:

easy to formulate: 
Avoid Unnecessary Braking especially on highway or driving with high speed
avoid acceleration when being overtaken
keep R_safe from other vehicles/pedestrians

hard: 
Stay in Your Lane After a Turn -> boundary of the road
avoid side by side driving
Don't Block the Intersection even if the light is green
take turns at a stop or merge
